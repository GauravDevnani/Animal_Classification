# 🌟Animal Image Classification🌟

## Overview
This project aims to build an image classification system capable of identifying various animal species from images. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras, demonstrating the end-to-end process of image dataset loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation for a multi-class classification problem.

## Dataset
The "animal_data" directory contains a rich collection of animal images, meticulously organized into distinct classes.

***Structure:*** The dataset is organized into 15 folders, where each folder represents a unique animal class.
***Classes:*** The dataset includes images for the following 15 animal categories:
⚡Bear

⚡Bird

⚡Cat

⚡Cow

⚡Deer

⚡Dog

⚡Dolphin

⚡Elephant

⚡Giraffe

⚡Horse

⚡Kangaroo

⚡Lion

⚡Panda

⚡Tiger

⚡Zebra

***Image Characteristics:*** Images are of dimensions 224×224×3 (height, width, color channels), making them suitable for standard deep learning models.
***Content:*** Each class folder contains a mix of original and augmented images, which helps in increasing the diversity and size of the training set, thereby improving model generalization.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

🪄To build a robust system that can accurately identify the animal present in a given image.

🪄To explore and understand the characteristics of the animal image dataset.

🪄To identify and implement an appropriate deep learning solution, potentially leveraging Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for enhanced performance.

## Methodology
The project follows a standard deep learning workflow for image classification:

***Data Loading:*** Images are loaded directly from the directory structure using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory, automatically inferring labels from folder names.

***Data Preprocessing:***

✔️Images are resized to a uniform size (e.g., 256×256) during loading.

✔️Pixel values are normalized to a range suitable for neural networks (e.g., 0-1).

✔️The dataset is prepared into batches for efficient training.

***Data Augmentation:*** (Implied by "augmented images" in dataset description, though not explicitly shown in current code snippets for ImageDataGenerator). This is crucial for improving model generalization by creating variations of existing images (e.g., rotations, flips, zooms).

***Model Architecture:*** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture typically includes:

✔️Conv2D layers for feature extraction.

✔️MaxPooling2D layers for dimensionality reduction.

✔️BatchNormalization for stable training.

✔️Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

✔️Flatten layer to transition to dense layers.

✔️Dense layers for classification with a softmax activation for multi-class output.

***Potential for Transfer Learning:*** The problem statement suggests experimenting with Transfer Learning, which would involve using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) as feature extractors.

***Model Compilation:*** The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam), a loss function for multi-class classification (e.g., sparse_categorical_crossentropy if labels are integer-encoded, or categorical_crossentropy if one-hot encoded), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).

***Model Training:*** The CNN is trained on the prepared dataset over multiple epochs, with validation monitoring to prevent overfitting.

***Evaluation:*** The trained model's performance is evaluated on unseen test data to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.
